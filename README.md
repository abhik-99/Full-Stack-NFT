# Full-Stack-NFT-

This is a sample project made by me in which a contract development, testing and deployment (on Polygon's Mumbai Testne)
has been done using Hardhat. The Repo also contains a simple frontend for checking if any address is whitelisted and then minting.

The user needs to sign-in by Signing a Message and then he/she/it can take the following actions:
1. Mint (per NFT costs 0.1 <nativ unit>) his/her/its address
2. Check if he/she/it is Whitelisted.
  
Please note that right now only `0xE61DCBb8B3dcf391B2144DD948738028431A4192` (mine) is Whitelisted.
